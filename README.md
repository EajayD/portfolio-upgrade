# portfolio-upgrade
Portfolio upgrade from the alpha version I previously had, hence the upgraded portfolio. While still looking largely the same as the alpha version, this upgraded version had been outfitted with Bootstrap which I did not have access to prior. Using Bootstrap allows for a better responsive and mobile experience. I have also updated it with projects and assignments that I have actually worked on, so no more placeholders.
